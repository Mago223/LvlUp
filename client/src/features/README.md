# Features Directory Structure

The features directory uses a modular architecture to organize code, separating concerns into distinct folders for better maintainability and scalability.

## Structure

```
src/features/(some-feature)
  assets/
  components/
  hooks/
  layouts/
  pages/
  services/
  styles/
  utils/
  index.js
```

## Folder Descriptions

-   `assets/`: Contains static files such as images, fonts, and other media.
-   `components/`: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
-   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for shared stateful logic across components.
-   `layouts/`: Components that define the overall structure of pages or sections.
-   `pages/`: Full page components that compose smaller components.
-   `services/`: API calls, data management, and other external service integrations.
-   `styles/`: Global styles, CSS modules, or styled-components files.
-   `utils/`: Helper functions and utility methods used across the application.
-   `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.

## Usage

1. Place reusable components in the `components/` folder.
2. Create full page components in the `pages/` folder.
3. Use `layouts/` for components that define page structures.
4. Put custom hooks in the `hooks/` folder.
5. Implement API calls and data management in `services/`.
6. Store global styles and CSS modules in `styles/`.
7. Keep helper functions and utilities in `utils/`.

## Guidelines

-   Use relative imports for files within the same folder, and absolute imports for shared resources.
-   Keep components as independent as possible. If a component is used across multiple pages, consider moving it to the `components/` folder.
-   Use custom hooks for shared logic between components.
-   Implement layouts for consistent page structures across the application.
-   Store API calls and data management logic in the `services/` folder.
-   Use the `styles/` folder for global styles and theme-related CSS.
-   Place utility functions that are used across the application in the `utils/` folder.

## Benefits

-   Clear separation of concerns
-   Improved code organization and maintainability
-   Easier navigation of the codebase
-   Promotes reusability of components and logic
-   Facilitates testing of individual parts of the application

## Adding New Features

1. Determine which folder(s) the new feature's code should reside in based on its purpose.
2. Implement the feature using the appropriate folders (e.g., new components in `components/`, new pages in `pages/`, etc.).
3. If the feature requires new assets, add them to the `assets/` folder.
4. For any new global styles, add them to the `styles/` folder.
5. If the feature introduces new utility functions, place them in the `utils/` folder.

This structure allows for scalable and maintainable development as your application grows, keeping related code organized and easily accessible.
